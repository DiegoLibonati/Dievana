## Description

I made a web page that allows you to view many movies. When you click on a movie, it will show you different information such as its title and a synopsis. In each box it will show the title of the movie, accompanied by an image and its rating. If the grade is higher than 7 it will be green, if it is lower than 6 it will be red and in the middle of 6 and 7 it will be yellow. In addition I made an intelligent search using a webworker to optimize the search.
